\chapter{Conclusion}

The goal of this analysis was to (1) identify road characteristics that lead in an increased risk of accident and ultimately to (2) identify road segments that have more accidents than is expected given the traffic levels and road characteristics. Through fitting a Poisson regression, we were able to identify which road characteristics are most strongly associated with increased accident risk. By including a spatial component, we were able to account for both spatial correlations and unmeasured effects on road segments. These unmeasured effects allowed us to identify road segments with higher accidents than expected given the traffic levels and road characteristics. \\

The spatial effects make it clear that the road characteristics alone do not contain all the information on number of accidents in a given road segment. There may be one or several road characteristics that haven't been included in the model that should be. By using
