\section{Model Diagnostics}
120,000 (15,000 burn-in) samples of posterior distribution were obtained using the adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm described in Chapter 3. Figure \ref{diagnostics} shows trace and autocorrelation plots for a randomly selected marginal posteriors of $\beta$ and $\phi$, as well as the marginal posteriors for both $s$ and $\tau$.

\end{figure}

Marginal distributions for nearly all $\beta$'s and $\phi$'s have very high autorrelation that can be seen in Figure \ref{diagnostics}. Despite the high autocorellation for the $\beta$'s and the $\phi$'s, the trace plots show that the MCMC has sufficiently explored the space of our parameters. The trace and autocorrelation plots for $s$ and $\tau$ indicate more than adquate convergence. We verify convergence of the MCMC using Monte Carlo standard errors \citep{jones06}. All of the MCMC standard errors for the $\beta$'s were less than .01. All of the MCMC standard errors except three for $\phi$ were smaller than .01. \\

To verify that the fitted model fits the data well, posterior predictive checks were used. Figure \ref{predictive} shows 95\% predictive intervals for each of the 207 road segments on the I35. Of the 207 intervals, 197 contain the observed value ($\approx 95\%$ coverage).

\section{Results:}
We are interested in what factors in the road lead to higher crash rates. As described in chapter 3, the $\beta$ coefficients give the relative risks of each road characteristic. If $\beta_p > 0$ then  increases in $x_p$ are associate with increased relative risk of accidents. \citet{betas} shows the central 95\% credible intervals for the intercept and each of the 11 covariates. Four covariates are above zero: (1) poor pavement conditions, (2) small and/or variable median width, (3) road width, and (4) right shoulder width. Small median width in particular stands out as having a large, positive association with increased risk of accidents. Small median widths are typically associated with highways in highly populated areas that have high volumes of traffic. Equation \eqref{Es} alone was unable to capture the effect of increased traffic.

The covariates in the model did not capture all of the risk factors. For this reason it is important to include the spatial effects into the model. Figure \ref{spatial} includes estimated spatial effects for each road segment. We are most interested in areas where the spatial effects have a strong positive effect.

Notice that segments 180-200 contain a high proportion of red segments. This indicates that these road segments have a higher relative crash rate than we would expect given the covariates. Segments 180-200 are associated with freeway segments in the Duluth-Superior metropolitan area. Reasons why crash rates are higher in Duluth than they should be could be for a variety of reasons including characteristics of the road such as high road curvature and steep roads or reasons could be socio-economic like a higher than normal drinking rate. 

Calculating $\mu_s=exp\{X_s'\beta + \phi_s\}$ gives us the relative risk (relative to the expected number of crashes $E_s$ from \eqref{Es}) for each road segment. Segments 24, 64,  65,  66, 107, 168, 169 (indicated in red in Figure \ref{relrisk} all have relative risk of over 2. These road segments should be examined to see why they have such a high risk. \\
